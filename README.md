# Setu — सेतु

> A tiny, self-hosted bridge from your local IoT devices to a fast, app-like web UI.

**Setu** (Sanskrit *सेतु*, "bridge") is a lightweight home-automation server designed to
run on low-resource hardware — a MikroTik RouterOS container, an OpenWrt router, a Raspberry
Pi (~256–512 MB RAM). It controls local devices and serves a small PWA control panel for
phones and desktops.

It is a **single static Go binary**. That one binary serves the embedded web app, the JSON
API, and a WebSocket for live updates. No NGINX, no separate web server, no process
supervisor.

> **Status.** The full architecture is in place, including bounded local automation, plus two real device integrations —
> **Philips WiZ** bulbs and **Samsung Tizen** TVs (see [Supported devices](#supported-devices)).
> Add more one at a time, by brand and model, following the `example` template and the two
> real packages. See [Adding a device](#adding-a-device).

```

**Event-driven core.** Commands flow *in* (HTTP → manager → device); state-change events
flow *out* (device/poller → event bus → WebSocket → browser). The event bus is a tiny
channel-based pub/sub. This powers both the live UI and the automation engine without putting
rule behavior in device code.

**Interfaces only at the real seams** (idiomatic Go: composition, not inheritance):

| Seam | Interface | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Device capabilities | `Switchable`, `Dimmable`, `ColorControl` (in `internal/device`) | New device features without changing existing devices; the API discovers support via type assertions |
| Address resolution | `Resolver` (in `internal/resolver`) | Swap MAC→IP strategies (ARP + per-brand discovery now; DHCP leases later) |
| Front-end protocol | the `api` package vs. the manager + event bus | A second protocol (e.g. an Apple HomeKit bridge) can be added beside `api`, talking to the same manager/bus, with no device-code changes |

## Build & run

### With Docker (recommended)

Setu needs the **host network** to reach LAN devices and read the ARP table.

```sh
make docker                       # or: docker build -t setu .
docker run --rm --network host \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/etc/setu/config.yaml:ro" \
  setu
```

Open `http://<host>` (port 80 by default), enter your `auth.token`, and you'll see the empty dashboard.

### From source

Requires Go 1.23+ and Node 20+.

```sh
make build        # builds the frontend, then the binary into ./bin/setu
make run          # build + run with ./config.yaml
```

`make build-arm64` cross-compiles a static `linux/arm64` binary for a MikroTik/OpenWrt/Pi.

### Hot-reload development

```sh
# terminal 1 — backend (set listen.port: 8080 in config.yaml for sudo-free dev)
go run ./cmd/setu -config config.yaml
# terminal 2 — frontend (Vite proxies /api and /ws to :8080)
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

> The shipped `config.yaml` defaults to port **80** (privileged). For hot-reload dev, set
> `listen.port: 8080` so the unprivileged backend matches the Vite proxy above.

> `go build ./...` works on a fresh checkout even before the frontend is built: the embed
> contains only a `.gitkeep`, and the server serves a small built-in placeholder page until
> you run `make web`.

---

## Configuration

`config.yaml` is **data only** — device *behaviour* lives in code, never in config.

```yaml
listen:
  port: 80               # TCP port (default 80; binding to 80 needs privilege)
  interface: ""          # bind address; blank = all interfaces
  # socket: /run/setu.sock  # serve on a Unix socket instead (tunnel-only)
  # tls:                  # optional own/self-signed cert → HTTPS (secure context for PWA)
  #   cert: /etc/setu/cert.pem
  #   key:  /etc/setu/key.pem
auth:
  token: "CHANGE_ME"     # bearer token required on /api and /ws — CHANGE THIS
poll_interval: 45s       # active cadence; idle polling backs off automatically
devices: []              # empty for now; see "Adding a device"
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `listen.port` | TCP port. Defaults to `80` (binding to 80 needs privilege — run as root or grant `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`). |
| `listen.interface` | Bind address (a network interface's IP, e.g. `192.168.1.10`). **Blank = all interfaces.** Use `127.0.0.1` for loopback only. |
| `listen.socket` | Optional Unix-domain socket path (e.g. `/run/setu.sock`) for tunnel-only, zero-open-port access. When set, it overrides `interface`/`port`. |
| `listen.tls.cert` / `listen.tls.key` | Optional PEM cert + key. Set **both** to serve HTTPS (stdlib TLS, no proxy) — needed for the PWA's secure-context features. Omit both for plain HTTP (the default, unchanged). No ACME; bring your own cert (or use Tailscale). |
| `auth.token` | Bearer token for `/api` and `/ws`. The server refuses to start with an empty token and warns if it's still `CHANGE_ME`. |
| `poll_interval` | Active-use cadence (default `45s`). After 2m without app activity or device changes, polling backs off through `5m`, `10m`, `30m`, `1h`, then `6h`. Opening/using the app resets the cadence; foreground/manual refresh polls immediately. `0` disables only scheduled polling. |
| `devices[]` | One entry per device: `id`, `brand`, `model`, `name`, `mac` (**required**, primary identity), `series` (optional friendly product/series name shown in the UI, e.g. `AU7700`). |

### HTTP / WebSocket API

Admin endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (the WebSocket also accepts `?token=`).
An incoming automation hook accepts only its separate per-rule bearer token.

| Method & path | Body | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/devices` | — | Cached `[]DeviceView` (id, name, brand, model, `series` (optional), mac, capabilities, optional `color_temp_min`/`color_temp_max`, state) — `[]` when none. Add `?refresh=true` for a one-shot hardware poll first. |
| `POST /api/activity` | — | Keeps the active polling cadence warm without polling hardware (`204`). |
| `POST /api/devices/{id}/command` | `{"action":"on"}` / `{"action":"off"}` | updated `DeviceView` |
| | `{"action":"set_brightness","value":70}` | (0–100) |
| | `{"action":"set_color","value":{"r":255,"g":120,"b":0}}` | |
| | `{"action":"set_color_temp","value":2700}` | white temperature (Kelvin) |
| | `{"action":"set_scene","value":11}` | preset scene id (see device `scenes`) |
| | `{"action":"set_scene_speed","value":120}` | dynamic-scene speed (10–200) |
| | `{"action":"volume_up"}` / `{"action":"volume_down"}` / `{"action":"mute"}` | relative volume / mute toggle |
| | `{"action":"set_volume","value":35}` | absolute volume (0–100) |
| | `{"action":"key","value":"KEY_HOME"}` | named remote key (tap) |
| | `{"action":"key_down","value":"KEY_RIGHT"}` / `{"action":"key_up","value":"KEY_RIGHT"}` | press-and-hold a key (the device auto-releases a hold the client never ends) |
| | `{"action":"send_text","value":"breaking bad"}` | type into the device's focused text field |
| `GET /ws` | — | WebSocket; pushes `{type,device_id,state}` (`snapshot` on connect, then `state_changed`) |
| `GET` / `PUT /api/automations` | complete revisioned rule state | list or atomically replace automations |
| `GET /api/automations/export` | — | backup form (hashed webhook secrets only) |
| `POST /api/automations/{id}/run` | — | queue a manual run |
| `POST /api/automations/{id}/token` | — | rotate and return a webhook token once |
| `POST /api/automation-hooks/{id}` | optional body (max 4 KB, ignored) | trigger one predefined rule with its per-rule bearer token |

The command body is **uniform and device-agnostic**. The API checks capability support with
type assertions and returns `400` if a device doesn't support an action (e.g. brightness on a
plain switch), `404` for an unknown device, `502` for a device/IO failure. Capabilities reported
today: `switch`, `brightness`, `color`, `color_temp`, `scene`, `volume`, `key`, `key_hold`,
`app`, `text`. A device that has `scene` also lists its presets in the `scenes` field of
`GET /api/devices`.

## Lightweight automation and backup

The Settings automation editor supports one trigger per rule: a minute-level schedule, a
device power-state edge, or an incoming webhook. Rules have up to four simple AND conditions
and sixteen ordered, idempotent actions. The runtime is deliberately bounded: 64 rules, two
fixed workers, a 32-entry queue, and the last 20 results in RAM only. Device relations that
form a power cycle are rejected. The event subscriber can request one snapshot resync after
overflow, so it needs no reconciliation ticker.
An action can run another automation inline while preserving action order; nested call graphs
must be acyclic, may be at most eight rules deep, and share 128-action / 960-second delay
budgets per run.

Webhook tokens are generated independently for each rule. The plaintext is returned only
when created/rotated; Setu stores a SHA-256 hash. Call the shown URL with
`Authorization: Bearer <webhook-token>` and optionally an `Idempotency-Key`. Keep Setu on a
trusted LAN/VPN or HTTPS tunnel; never expose it raw to the internet.

Settings creates one versioned JSON backup. Export checkboxes select favourites, rooms,
manual scenes, layout/theme, and/or automations. Restore has one action: every section present
in the file replaces that type; omitted sections stay untouched. Access tokens, live device
state/cache, IP/MAC configuration, pairing-token plaintext, and run history are never exported.

---

## Device addressing — MAC is primary, IP is resolved at runtime

IoT devices keep a fixed **MAC** but their **IP can change** (DHCP). So in Setu:

- `mac` is the **required, stable** identity in config; device IPs are never stored there.
- You can't address a device by MAC at the application layer (MAC is Layer 2). At runtime Setu
  resolves the current IP from the MAC, **caches** it, and **re-resolves on send failure** (the
  device may have a new lease). The `example` template shows this pattern (`resolveIP` /
  `invalidateIP`).

Resolution sits behind one interface:

```go
type Resolver interface {
    Lookup(mac string) (net.IP, error)
}
```

- **ARP table** — the default, built now. Reads `/proc/net/arp` and matches the MAC. Requires
  host networking and only knows devices the host has talked to recently.
- **Per-device discovery** — built per brand. WiZ answers a UDP broadcast with its MAC;
  Samsung TVs answer SSDP and are then verified through `/api/v2/`'s `wifiMac` before their
  current IP is cached.
- **DHCP lease table** — *future.* OpenWrt `/tmp/dhcp.leases`, RouterOS via API. Same interface.

---

## Listener options

The `listen` block:

- **TCP (default)** — `port` (default `80`) on `interface`. **Blank `interface` = all
  interfaces;** set it to one address (e.g. `127.0.0.1` for loopback) to **bind to a trusted
  interface**, and secure it with a VPN (WireGuard / Tailscale) or a firewall. **Never expose
  Setu raw to the internet.** Binding to port 80 needs privilege (run as root or grant
  `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`).
- **Unix socket** — set `socket: /run/setu.sock` for zero open ports; reach it over an SSH
  tunnel (`ssh -L 8080:/run/setu.sock user@router`). Laptop-friendly; phones need a tunnel app.
  When set, it overrides `interface`/`port`.
- **TLS (optional)** — set `tls.cert` **and** `tls.key` (PEM paths) and Setu serves HTTPS
  itself (stdlib `crypto/tls`, no proxy). Leave them unset and it serves plain HTTP exactly as
  before. This is what makes the LAN address a *secure context* so the PWA can install and run
  its service worker (see below). Bring your own cert (self-signed is fine on a LAN) — there is
  **no** ACME/Let's Encrypt auto-cert.

Graceful shutdown is handled on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.

### Reaching Setu by name (e.g. `http://setu.lan`)

Setu's server answers on **any hostname** that resolves to its IP — no Setu config is
needed for this; it's purely **DNS**. With port 80 as the default, `http://setu.lan` (no
`:port`) just works once the name resolves. `.lan` is your router's local domain, so set it up
there:

- **Router DNS (recommended).** On most home routers / OpenWrt (dnsmasq), set the Setu host's
  hostname to `setu` — it's then auto-served as `setu.lan`. Or add a static record, e.g.
  dnsmasq `address=/setu.lan/192.168.0.50`. RouterOS: a static DNS entry.
- **Per-client (no router access).** Add `192.168.0.50  setu.lan` to each device's hosts file
  (`/etc/hosts`, or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`).

> mDNS/Bonjour can give a zero-config name too, but only under **`.local`** (`setu.local`), not
> `.lan`, and would add a dependency — so for `.lan`, router DNS is the lightweight path.
> Note: `http://setu.lan` is still plain HTTP (not a secure context), so PWA install stays
> blocked — see below.

### PWA & the secure-context requirement

Service workers and "Add to Home Screen" (install, fullscreen, offline app shell) only work in
a **secure context** — HTTPS **or** `localhost`. Plain `http://<lan-ip>` loads fine but
the browser blocks PWA features (the frontend feature-detects this and simply skips the service
worker over plain HTTP). No proxy is needed — Go serves TLS natively. Easiest options:

- **Tailscale** — gives automatic HTTPS on your `*.ts.net` name, zero config in Setu.
- **`localhost`** via an SSH tunnel — counts as secure, nothing else needed.
- **Own / self-signed cert** — set `listen.tls.cert` + `listen.tls.key` (see *Listener options*)
  and trust the cert once on each device. Generate one with, e.g.:

  ```sh
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 \
    -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -subj "/CN=setu.lan" \
    -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:setu.lan,IP:192.168.0.50"
  ```

Once on HTTPS, the app is installable across iOS, Android, macOS, Windows and Linux — one PWA,
no app store. Long-press / right-click the installed icon for the **All on / All off** shortcuts.

If upgrading from a build whose installed app goes blank specifically after refresh, open
`https://<your-setu-host>/api/recover` once. It removes only Setu's service worker and shell
cache, keeps the access token and UI preferences, and returns to the fixed app automatically.

## Supported devices

| Brand · model (`brand`/`model`) | Capabilities | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Philips WiZ — `WiZ`/`color_bulb` | switch, brightness, color, color_temp, scene | UDP :38899 (local, no cloud) |
| Philips WiZ White — `WiZ`/`tunable_white` | switch, brightness, color_temp, scene | UDP :38899 (local, no cloud) |
| Samsung Tizen TV — `Samsung`/`tizen` | switch (power), volume (absolute + mute), key, key_hold, app, text | REST :8001 + WebSocket/TLS :8002 + UPnP :9197 + Wake-on-LAN |

### Philips WiZ (`WiZ`/`color_bulb`, `WiZ`/`tunable_white`)

- Pure local control over UDP — no cloud, login, or key. On/off, brightness (10–100; the WiZ
  hardware floor is 10%, so lower values clamp), RGB color, **white temperature** (2200–6500 K),
  and the **32 predefined scenes** (color / white-temp / scene are exclusive modes on the bulb).
- IP resolution chain: ARP table → **WiZ UDP broadcast discovery** (matches the bulb by MAC).
  Discovery means a DHCP IP change is handled automatically — this is the
  per-brand discovery the `Resolver` seam anticipates (`internal/devices/wiz/discovery.go`).
- Tunable-white-only WiZ bulbs use `model: tunable_white`: switch, brightness,
  2700–6500 K color temperature, and the supported white scenes (ids 9–16).
  They deliberately omit RGB/color modes, which this hardware ignores.

### Samsung Tizen TV (`Samsung`/`tizen`)

- **MAC-only addressing:** no `ip` is needed in config. Setu discovers DIAL receivers over
  SSDP, verifies the candidate TV's `/api/v2/` `wifiMac` against the configured MAC, caches the
  current IP, and repeats discovery after a transport failure invalidates that cache.
- **Power on** = Wake-on-LAN (sprayed at each interface's directed broadcast + the limited
  broadcast, ports 9 & 7). ✅ Verified to wake a UA50AU7700KLXL from off. ⚠️ WoL over Wi-Fi can
  still fail if the TV's network-standby ("Power On with Mobile") is off — that's a Samsung/Wi-Fi
  limit, not Setu. **Power off**, volume, and navigation keys (over the WebSocket) work when the
  TV is on.
- **Volume & mute are real state:** the slider sets an absolute level over UPnP
  (RenderingControl) and Setu reads volume + mute back on every poll, so changes made with the
  physical remote show up in the UI within a tick.
- **Press-and-hold** on every remote button (`key_down`/`key_up`): a hold the client never ends
  is auto-released by a watchdog — a stuck key would otherwise freeze the TV's remote channel.
- **Text input:** type into whatever field is focused on the TV; the card mirrors the TV-side
  field live (focused or not, current contents) from the TV's IME events.
- **First-use pairing:** the first power-off/key/volume command makes the TV show an **Allow**
  prompt — accept it once. Setu captures the returned token and caches it. Set the TV's *General →
  External Device Manager → Device Connection Manager → Access Notification* to "First Time Only".
- **Token cache:** `$SETU_STATE_DIR/setu-samsung-<id>.token` (defaults to the OS temp dir). Point
  `SETU_STATE_DIR` at a persistent path so the token survives reboots.
- **Same L2 segment required:** Samsung blocks the remote WebSocket across subnets/VLANs — keep
  Setu and the TV on the same segment.
- The TV serves its WebSocket/HTTPS with a self-signed cert, which Setu trusts (a known LAN device
  resolved from its MAC). Remote keys are validated against `KEY_[A-Z0-9_]+`; `KEY_FACTORY`
  (service menu) is refused.

## Adding a device

This is the core next step, and the whole architecture is built around making it small and
local. Two real packages show the pattern applied to hardware: `internal/devices/wiz` (a compact
UDP device) and `internal/devices/samsung` (REST + WebSocket + Wake-on-LAN, and how new
capabilities like `volume`/`key` light up matching UI controls). Each device lives in its own package, organised **by brand → model**. Use
[`internal/devices/example`](internal/devices/example/example.go) as the blueprint — it is a
fully-commented, compiling template (a brand `base` with the transport, an embedded model type,
capability methods, resolver usage, and factory registration).

1. **Copy the template:** `internal/devices/example/` → `internal/devices/<brand>/`. Set the
   `Brand` / `Model` constants.
2. **Implement the transport** in the brand `base` (`send`) — the UDP/TCP/HTTP protocol. On a
   network error, call `invalidateIP()` so the next call re-resolves the MAC.
3. **Per model**, define a type embedding `base` and implement `Model()`, `Capabilities()`, and
   only the capability interfaces that model supports (`Switchable`, `Dimmable`,
   `ColorControl`). Different models of the same brand can differ. Update the compile-time
   `var _ device.X = (*T)(nil)` assertions.
4. **Implement `Poll()`** to read real hardware state (or omit `Pollable` entirely).
5. **Export** `New` (a `config.Constructor`) and `Register(*config.Factory)`.
6. **Register it** with one line in `cmd/setu/main.go`:
   ```go
   wiz.Register(factory)   // next to example.Register(factory)
   ```
7. **Add a config entry:**
   ```yaml
   devices:
     - id: living_light
       brand: WiZ   # case-insensitive (wiz / WiZ both work)
       model: color_bulb
       name: "Living Room"
       mac: "a8:bb:50:11:22:33"   # primary identity
   ```

The frontend needs **no changes** — `DeviceCard` renders the right controls from the device's
reported `capabilities`.

### Not yet (by design)

- No scripting, generic nested rules, outbound webhooks, MQTT, or persistent automation history.
- No HomeKit — but the front-end-protocol seam (the `api` package over the manager/bus) keeps it
  addable later without touching device code.
- A TV's power state is read from REST `device.PowerState` (on vs. standby), volume/mute over
  UPnP — all real, polled state. Only firmware too old to report `PowerState` falls back to
  reachability (where network standby can read as "on").

---

## Deployment notes

**General.** Setu must share the **host network** (LAN reachability, ARP, and future UDP
broadcast / mDNS). Mount your `config.yaml`. Set `SETU_STATE_DIR` to a writable persistent
directory for automations and Samsung pairing tokens; otherwise the OS temp directory is used.

**MikroTik RouterOS (container).** Build the `linux/arm64` (or your arch) image, import it into
the `container` package, attach it to a veth on your LAN bridge, and mount a config volume.
Cross-compile locally with `make build-arm64` if building off-device.

**OpenWrt.** Drop the static `linux/<arch>` binary on the router (e.g. `/usr/bin/setu`), add a
small procd/init script pointing at `/etc/setu/config.yaml`, and (future) read leases from
`/tmp/dhcp.leases` via a DHCP resolver. The binary is fully static (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), so it has
no libc dependency.

## Documentation

Beyond this file, docs are kept **point-to-point** for humans and AI assistants:

- **Native device protocols:** [`docs/devices/wiz.md`](docs/devices/wiz.md),
  [`docs/devices/samsung.md`](docs/devices/samsung.md) — how to call each device on the wire.
- **Per-module context:** every package has its own `README.md`
  (`internal/*/README.md`, `cmd/setu/`, `web/`) — purpose, key types, flow, gotchas, how to extend.
- **Index:** [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

## Why these dependencies?

Kept deliberately minimal (standard library does the rest):

- **`github.com/coder/websocket`** — small, context-aware, zero-dependency WebSocket library.
- **`gopkg.in/yaml.v3`** — human-friendly config with comments and `5s`-style durations.
- **Frontend:** Svelte 5 (tiny runtime → small JS heap, important on mobile), Vite, Tailwind.
  No heavy UI kit.
